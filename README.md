## Description 

For the second homework assignment, or submission, I was given the task to start coding from scratch.  The purpose was to make an initial, or start-up portfolio page.  This will be updated throughout the class as more advanced learning takes place.  


## Code Contributors
The project was completed by each student separetely.  This was completed by Paul Nixon. Coding languages HTML and CSS were used.  


## User Story 
The user story is from the UPENN assignment Module #2.

As an potential employer [User], the goal is to visualize the work of starting a portfolio from zero code in order to see the work and projects completed by the new developer, Paul Nixon. 


## Acceptance Criteria
The assignment is complete when all aspects of the UPENN Module #2 Acceptance Criteria points are met. 


## Assets
